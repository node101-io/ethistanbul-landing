### **ETHIstanbul Code of Conduct**

Dear Participant,

ETHIstanbul is an event by the community, for the community. Its purpose is to bring builders together, foster collaboration, and create space for meaningful exchange. The ETHIstanbul team reserves the right to ask anyone to leave if their behavior is not respectful, constructive, or aligned with our shared values. We will not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.

We are committed to creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of background, education, religion, beliefs, abilities, gender, or sexual identity. If someone disregards these values, we will take appropriate action.

Please don’t aggressively self-promote or shill. If you are promoting malicious or deceptive content, we will act accordingly.

ETHIstanbul takes place in Istanbul, Türkiye. We ask all participants to comply with local laws and to respect the venues and spaces we gather in.

If you witness behavior that negatively impacts others’ ability to enjoy ETHIstanbul, please speak to a staff member (they will be clearly identifiable). You will be connected with someone who can handle your report privately and appropriately.

We’re glad to have you with us. Don’t hesitate to reach out to our team, we’re here to help and ensure ETHIstanbul is a great experience for everyone.
